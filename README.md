Technology stack
We have a specific set of technologies we want to see you using:
React v16+
React Hooks
Redux or similar state management approach
React Router
styled-components is preferred for styling (or any other approach if you aren't familiar with CSS-in-JS)
ESLint and Prettier for code style consistency is strongly recommended
You are free to use any UI kit you're familiar with – Bootstrap / Semantic UI / Ant Design / Material UI / others
You are not limited by the list above, though React should be the primary view library used in your project.
